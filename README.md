# Roadmap to (technically) Dominate Artificial Intelligence

In this document I link some of the material that I consider relevant to become knowlegable in the field of Artificial Intelligence. I suggest you do the homeworks and implement the ideas from the papers, as they would make sure you understand the ideas. A few notes:
1. I do not consider myself an AI expert, so I am open to suggestions (please use PR).
2. I have not necessarily fully studied all this material, some of it has been recommended to my by some friends.
3. A lot of the content may seem a bit redundant, I hope you are wise enough to realize what you can ignore.

**Conventions**

The following tags are used to qualify the content:

## Prerequisites
It is good to have this section here for reference, but I suggest you start with the core material and come back to this section if you feel lost in some ideas or tasks, specially if you have studied the prerequisites before.

## Artificial Intelligence
Although it is true that AI is much more than Machine Learning and (therefore) Deep Learning, Deep Learning is a great deal of AI this days.
