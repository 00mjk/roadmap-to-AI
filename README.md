# Roadmap to (technically) Dominate Artificial Intelligence

In this document we link some of the material that we consider relevant to become knowlegable in the field of Artificial Intelligence. We suggest you do the homeworks and implement the ideas from the papers, as they would make sure you understand the ideas. A few notes:
1. We do not consider ourselfs AI experts, so we are open to suggestions (please use PR).
2. We have not necessarily fully studied all this material, some of it is recommended by the community.
3. A lot of the content may seem a bit redundant, we hope you are wise enough to realize what you can ignore.

**Conventions**

The following tags are used to mark content at different levels:
* *Type*, related to the particular desired for study some conent: ![Theory](https://img.shields.io/badge/type-theory-brightgreen.svg) ![Practical](https://img.shields.io/badge/type-practice-green.svg)
* *Level*, the mastery of the subjects you will have after fully studied the content: ![Low-level](https://img.shields.io/badge/level-low-orange.svg) ![mid-level](https://img.shields.io/badge/level-mid-green.svg) ![high-level](https://img.shields.io/badge/level-high-greenlight.svg)
* *Format*, how the content is presented: ![lecture](https://img.shields.io/badge/format-lecture-blue.svg) ![read](https://img.shields.io/badge/format-read-blueviolet.svg)

The badges may apply to a particular content, subsection or section of this document.

## Prerequisites
It is good to have this section here for reference, but we suggest you start with the core material and come back to this section if you feel lost in some ideas or tasks, specially if you have studied the prerequisites before.

## Artificial Intelligence
